Benefits of BDD:
         Collaboration:
                This process involves multiple stakeholders and their understanding of the project.
                Having all the stakeholders involved from the beginning and throughout the process
                fosters strong communication and engage in the product development cycle.
         Focus on End Users:
                BDD puts the customer's vision in mind first. BDD focuses on the user's view on how
                the application should behave. By focusing on the user's view, this takes out the
                "what-ifs" from all the different stakeholders to deliver the product in a shorter software
         Business Values:
                Implementing BDD automates redundant processes and creates structured scenarios by writing
                test scenarios in an easily-decipherable language - Gherkin. Eliminating lag time in between
                processe
                s means that businesses can focus on client priorities and deliver results faster.
